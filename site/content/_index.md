    Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant
    brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep,
    equip you with everything good for doing His will, and may He work in us
    what is pleasing to Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and
    ever. Amen.
